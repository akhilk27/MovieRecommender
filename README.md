# Movie Recommender System
A recommendation system built with Python, pandas, and Streamlit.

## Description
This project uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend movies based on keywords, genres, actors, and directors. It leverages data from the TMDB 5000 Movies dataset to provide personalized movie suggestions.

## How the Model Was Built

The recommendation system was developed in several key steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - **Source**: The system uses two datasets from TMDB: `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` (movie details) and `tmdb_5000_credits.csv` (cast and crew info).
   - **Merging**: These datasets are merged on the `title` column to create a unified dataset.
   - **Feature Selection**: Relevant columns (`movie_id`, `title`, `overview`, `genres`, `keywords`, `cast`, `crew`) are retained.
   - **Cleaning**: Missing values are dropped, and duplicates are checked (none found).

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - **Text Transformation**: 
     - `overview` is split into individual words.
     - `genres`, `keywords`, and `cast` (top 3 actors) are extracted from JSON strings using `ast.literal_eval` and converted into lists of names.
     - `crew` is processed to extract the director's name.
   - **Space Removal**: Spaces are removed from multi-word entries (e.g., "Science Fiction" â†’ "ScienceFiction") to treat them as single tokens.
   - **Tag Creation**: A `tags` column is created by combining `overview`, `genres`, `keywords`, `cast`, and `director` into a single string, converted to lowercase for consistency.

3. **Text Processing**:
   - **Sorting and Deduplication**: Tags are sorted alphabetically within phrases and sub-phrases are removed to avoid redundancy (e.g., "action" and "action adventure" are deduplicated).
   - **Vectorization**: 
     - Instead of simple stemming, TF-IDF Vectorization (`TfidfVectorizer`) is used with:
       - `max_features=6000`: Limits vocabulary to the 6000 most frequent terms.
       - `stop_words='english'`: Removes common English words.
       - `max_df=0.8`: Ignores terms appearing in more than 80% of documents.
       - `min_df=10`: Ignores terms appearing in fewer than 10 documents.
     - Custom weights are applied to prioritize genres (e.g., `action: 2.0`, `comedy: 1.8`) and thematic keywords (e.g., `superhero: 1.9`).

4. **Similarity Calculation**:
   - **Cosine Similarity**: The TF-IDF vectors are used to compute a cosine similarity matrix (`similarity`), where each entry represents how similar two movies are based on their tags.

5. **Recommendation Logic**:
   - **Content-Based**: For a selected movie, the system finds the top 5 most similar movies from the `similarity` matrix.
   - **Actor/Director-Based**: Additional recommendations are generated by matching movies with the same top actors or director from the selected movie.

6. **Storage**:
   - The processed dataset (`derived`) and similarity matrix (`similarity`) are saved as `.pkl` files for efficient loading in the Streamlit app.
